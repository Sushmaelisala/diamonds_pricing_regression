📘 Dynamic Pricing Regression Model
📌 Project Overview
This project implements a regression-based machine learning model to predict optimal prices dynamically based on various product or market features. The goal is to enhance revenue by recommending prices that align with demand patterns and market conditions.

📊 Features (Inputs to Model)
Historical pricing data

Product/category features

Demand indicators

Competitor pricing

Temporal features (e.g., day of week, season)

🎯 Output
Trained regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.

Metrics: MAE, RMSE, R² score

Visualizations: Feature importance, prediction vs actual plots

📈 Model Performance
Evaluation metrics are used to assess the accuracy of predictions. The model with the best metrics (lowest MAE/RMSE, highest R²) is selected for final deployment.

🧠 Future Improvements
Integrate real-time pricing API

Add time-series analysis

Optimize for pricing elasticity and conversion rates
